# Solving ethernaut using foundry
solved ethernaut challs using foundry.
```
script/ : script files to solve the challenge
challs/ : challenge codes
test/ : nothing
src/ : contract codes for the challenges that needed a seperately deployed contract to solve the chall
```
For some of the challs, I directly used `cast call` or `cast storage` to solve it so the rep might be missing solve scripts for some of them.

All of the scripts and solve contracts are mine and no writeups were involved when solving the challenges.
